bug when hosting and connecting locally,
from 127.0.0.1 and from local IP in the same session. (SOLVED with connect(3))

NICE GUIDE: https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/html/split/

next to_do: valgrind, hellgrind, general cleanup (remember backups on the way)

lore:
    1. HOLE PUNCHING for host succesion
    2. optimize server resend of info (just updated info)

cleanup my mess :D [! ! !remember BACKUPS on the way! ! !]
    1. free allocs (recenv in server e client)
    2. close sockets
    3. destroy mutex
    4. check data races

next-to-do:
    push_up() "pushes all player up"
    client_player_stack()   "moves the new host at the top" (and check for init bugs)
    host relink after transfer (shouldn't register new players if the old ones try to connect)
    draw how the program works

future fixes:
    spam stream afterr rdeath (localhost)
    new-host:�1:�#׼�
